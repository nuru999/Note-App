 **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates how to create a web application using the Flask framework in Python. The application is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it ideal for junior developers who are new to web development.

**Prerequisites**

To run this application, you will need the following:

* Python 3.6 or later
* Flask
* A text editor

**Installation**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Running the Application**

To run the application, simply run the following command in the terminal window:

```
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask development server on port 5000. You can then access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to the following URL:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

**Code Overview**

The code for this application is located in the `app.py` file. The following is a brief overview of the code:

* The `create_app()` function creates a Flask application instance.
* The `__main__` block is the entry point of the application. It creates an application instance and then runs the development server.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

The following is a step-by-step explanation of the code in the `app.py` file:

1. The `create_app()` function creates a Flask application instance. This function is called in the `__main__` block to create the application instance that will be used by the development server.
2. The `app` variable is assigned to the return value of the `create_app()` function. This variable will be used to access the application instance throughout the code.
3. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is the entry point of the application. This block checks if the script is being run directly (as opposed to being imported as a module). If the script is being run directly, it creates an application instance and then runs the development server.
4. The `app.run(debug=True)` statement starts the Flask development server on port 5000. The `debug` parameter is set to `True` to enable debug mode, which allows
